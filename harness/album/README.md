# Album harness

Spotify's album page mocked under its own class names and accessibility identifiers
(from `trees/clean/album/03.txt`), so `Redesigned/Album/` can be laid out and looked at
on the Mac without the phone.

    THEOS=$HOME/theos ./build.sh
    xcrun simctl install booted build/AlbumHarness.app
    xcrun simctl launch booted com.vojta.albumharness
    xcrun simctl io booted screenshot shot.png

`build.sh` runs `logos.pl -c generator=internal` over the four `.x` files and links them with the
real `Core/` and `Redesigned/Kit/` sources; `stubs.m` stands in for the two hook files the harness
does not compile (`SGRAccent.x`, `SGRRepaint.x`).

The mock is the page as Spotify builds it: the colour wash behind the header, the header itself down
its four stack views, the metadata row as a real collection view with its own cells, the action row of
explore, add, download and more, the two controls Spotify floats over the page outside the scroll
(shuffle and play), and a list of track cells followed by the footer Spotify sends — the album's own
line, the copyright, and the headings and carousels of more by, videos, merch and you might also like,
each with the 16pt spacer between them.

At 1.5 s it measures the footer the way the page's collection does, asking every cell
`preferredLayoutAttributesFittingAttributes:` and stacking the answers: that is where `AlbumSections.x`
answers 0 for what it drops, and the log says how much footer was left (108pt of 1230pt, the album's
own line and its copyright).

Since 2026-09-18 the header is the Kit's `SGRHeaderInfo` over Spotify's blanked column, so what follows no
longer tests anything the redesign moves; it still shows Spotify's column staying blank. The metadata row's
cells arrive after the header's pass, which is what `AlbumHeader.x`'s re-read answers.

`late` on the launch line (`xcrun simctl launch booted com.vojta.albumharness late`) opens the album the way a
first open has it, with no add in the row, and adds it at 2.5 s as an arranged subview of the row, which lays out
nothing above the row. At 3 s the log says what the row shows on Play's right: "Add" once `AlbumHeader.x` watches
the row, "Download" before it did (issue #19).

At 3.5 s it puts Spotify's own frames back on the title block, its stack and the action row and asks
both groups for a layout pass, which is what the redesign's `SGRObserveLayout` watches have to survive.
The log says what the redesign answered with.

`SGLog` goes to the unified log rather than stdout, so the redesign's own lines are read with

    xcrun simctl spawn booted log stream --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "spotifyglass"' --style compact

What it does not cover: the real element framework's autolayout and the heights it measures, the page
scrolling (Spotify fades the header out by alpha as it goes, which the mock does not), and the flags
`AlbumField.x` forces.

`download` on the launch line plays the download button's states instead of the header's (issue #65), from
`../download-mock.h`: Spotify's button drawn by Lottie with no image view, its state in its accessibility
identifier and in a mock of the Encore object behind it (`currentState`, `progress`), and shuffle's "on" dot.
None, waiting, downloading (held at 50%), downloaded, shuffle on, removed with shuffle off, error, each held a
few seconds and announced with a `[harness] state:` line to take a screenshot on. Nothing in it lays anything
out, as on the phone.
