// Player redesign: the lyrics come to the player itself, the way the Music app shows them. The player
// is one screen and does not scroll (PlayerScroll.x), so the footer's lyrics glyph is the only way to
// them: it shrinks the cover into a thumbnail at the top of the artwork band, lifts the track's title
// up beside it, and fades the Apple Music style lines (Redesigned/Lyrics/SGRKaraokeView.h) into the
// room that frees between the title and the progress bar. Tapping it again puts the cover back.
//
// Nothing of Spotify's is taken apart for it. The cover is the Kit's now playing artwork drawn again
// in a view of the redesign's own, flown from where Spotify's cover is drawn to where the thumbnail
// belongs, while Spotify's list of covers goes to alpha 0 underneath: one view to move instead of a
// paging list of them, and the two pictures are the same one, so the swap is not seen. The title row
// is Spotify's own unit translated, the way PlayerFooter.x moves the footer's controls -- a transform
// survives the stack view laying its arranged views out again -- with a mask over it where the controls
// it moved towards begin, so a long title fades out before them instead of running under them. The row
// of chips over it (Switch to video) goes while the lines are up, since they take the room it sits in.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/player/01.txt): SPTNowPlayingView (:26) holds the content layers, the header row
// (:91), and id=npv.bottomStackView {0, 576.67, 402, 236} (:127) whose arranged views are the
// information unit {0, 0, 402, 64} (:160, the title, the artist and the add button), the duration unit
// {0, 64, 402, 40} (:209), the controls (:240) and the footer (:295). The title is
// id=now-playing-title-label and the artist id=now-playing-subtitle-label (:174, :185), both inside one
// arranged element view {12, 2.33, 304, 43.33} of the unit's row. Every measurement here is taken from
// the views themselves, since a player with a volume row or another mode's units has other numbers.
//
// The geometry is re-applied on every layout pass of the units, since a new track rebuilds the
// elements inside them, and it is undone before the player closes: the bar morphs back into a full
// size cover, which a thumbnail would not match.
