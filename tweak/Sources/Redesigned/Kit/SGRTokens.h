// The redesign's design tokens: every redesigned screen takes its colours, type, spacing, radii and
// motion from here, so the screens read as one app and nothing is tuned per screen by hand.
//
// Colours are white over the artwork field (SGRField.h), whose colour is kept dark enough that
// SGRPrimary and SGRSecondary both pass WCAG AA on it. Type is the system font (SF Pro) sized by the
// text style and capped, since Spotify's pages lay out for a fixed header height. Motion is springs,
// critically damped for layout and a little bounce for press feedback; under Reduce Motion both
// become instant, while crossfades stay, a fade not being motion.
//
// Threading: the constants and the colours are safe anywhere; fonts, SGRAnimate and the
// accessibility reads are main thread only.
