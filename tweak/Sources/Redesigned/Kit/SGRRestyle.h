// stack: OverflowStackView and some Encore stacks trap in updateConstraints when an arranged view
// hides, so a view goes away by alpha, touches and accessibility instead.

// Ownership: what a helper creates belongs to the view it was made for (associated objects), and a
// helper keeps only weak references to Spotify's views.

// the full-width fade a "see more" draws over its last row, which the black makes a dark band. The Kit's
// repaint hook misses all of it -- it only hears about a colour when Spotify sets it, and a cell is painted
// before it is inside the page and brings its old paint with it when it is reused -- so this runs from the
// cell's own layout pass, and is cheap enough to.
//
// Only what is nearly as wide as the cell: a badge's black disc, a card's grey and an image's placeholder
