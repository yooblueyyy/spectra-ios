// What Spotify's download button says -- not downloaded, waiting, downloading and how far, downloaded, failed
// -- and the glyph the redesign draws for it, the Music app's: an arrow, a ring filling up with a stop square
// in it, and a filled arrow in a circle once everything is on the phone (issue #65).
//
// Spotify draws that button with Lottie, so there is no image to copy the way the action row copies the
// other glyphs. What it does have is a state in words: the button's accessibility identifier is
// `DownloadButton.Granular.<None|Waiting|Downloading|Downloaded|Error>` (every one of the five is a string
// in the 9.1.78 binary), and the Encore object that owns the button -- the button's own action target --
// keeps `currentState` and `progress` in stored properties the runtime lists by name (Swift field metadata:
// GranularDownloadButton { currentState: GranularDownloadButtonState, progress: Optional<8 bytes> }, the
// state being none, waiting, downloading, downloadingEndless, downloaded, error in that order).
//
// Threading: main thread only.
