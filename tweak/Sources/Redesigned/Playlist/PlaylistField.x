// Playlist redesign: the artwork field behind the whole page, and what the switch forces.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/playlist/02.txt:23 and :1096): FTPViewController's view holds the list
// (ListUXPlatform_FreeTierPlaylistImpl.FTPTouchCancellingCollectionView, id=SPTFreeTierPlaylistTableView,
// the size of the window) and, after it and so over it, the header (id=PL.Header). Neither scrolls the
// other: the list keeps its frame and the header's y runs from -134 at rest to -529 scrolled, so a field
// put behind both stays still while the cover at the top of the header slides up over it -- which is what
// the Music app does with the page colour.
//
// So the field is the page's bottom-most view, the size of the view and bleeding past it, with no backdrop
// of its own: the sharp cover at the top of the header is the picture, and PlaylistHeader.x fades it into
// exactly this field's colour. What Spotify paints over the field -- the page, the list and every row, all
// of them the base surface -- is kept clear by the Kit's repaint hook while sgr_playlistRoot is this page.
//
// The colour is read from the cover the header shows (PlaylistHeader.x hands it over), and until that has
// loaded the field is the neutral one, as it is for a playlist with no cover at all.
