// Playlist redesign: the header the Music app gives a playlist (iOS 26.4). The cover runs full bleed across
// the top of the page and dissolves into the page's colour; the title, the creator and the length are centred
// on the bottom of that dissolve; under them one row -- shuffle, a white Play capsule, and save (someone
// else's playlist) or download (one's own, Liked Songs) -- and the description last.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/playlist/01.txt:640-869). Spotify's header is id=PL.Header, and at rest its
// HeaderContentLayout starts at the very top of the page. It holds exactly two things:
//
//     Components.Header.UI.ArtworkImage   a ShadowContainer, the cover square, centred at {80, 68} 243x243
//     the block                           a plain UIView at {0, 327} 386x178: a column of title, description,
//                                         creator row and length, and under it the action row
//
// A mix Spotify makes (Indie Rock Mix, Discover Weekly) is laid out the same way but draws its cover
// differently: there is no artwork square, and in its place a HeaderFullbleedCentralView holds the picture
// full bleed with Spotify's own big title over the bottom of it (trees/continuous/4.txt:1066). So the cover
// is whichever of the two the layout has, and the block is the one thing that is neither.
//
// Nothing is measured from what the header shows: -[SPTFreeTierPlaylistEncoreHeaderViewController update]
// counts a stored fullHeaderHeight and pins headerViewHeightConstraint to it. So the redesign changes no
// height: the cover's square is where the full bleed picture goes, and the block keeps its place, its size
// and its fading as the header collapses.
//
// What is in the block is the redesign's own (the Kit's SGRHeaderInfo), not Spotify's rearranged. Moving Spotify's
// column and controls meant answering every layout pass of theirs -- stacks re-arranging, Auto Layout putting
// frames back, buttons flashing where Spotify wanted them -- so Spotify's contents of the block are concealed
// whole and one view of the redesign's own is drawn in their place, which nothing of Spotify's lays out. It
// reads what it shows from the page's view model (FTPViewModelImplementation: the name, the description,
// whose playlist it is; device 2026-09-18) and from Spotify's concealed labels where the model has no getter
// (the creator, and the length line, already in the app's language). Its buttons draw Spotify's glyphs and
// fire Spotify's own concealed controls, so every action, state and language stays Spotify's.
