// Playlist redesign: Sort and Mix on the playlist's ⋯ sheet, where the rest of Spotify's curation row
// already is.
//
// Spotify puts seven pills over the first track -- Add, Mix, Notes, Video, Edit, Sort, Name & details
// (own-playlist/01.txt:33) -- and the Music app has none of them: its playlist sorts from its own ⋯ menu.
// So PlaylistRows.x closes the row up and these two rows stand in its place, because Sort and Mix are the
// only two of the seven the ⋯ menu does not already offer.
//
// **Why these are rows of the mod's own and not rows of Spotify's menu.** The sheet is
// ContextMenu_InternalImpl.ContextMenuViewController, a table whose rows come from Swift item factories
// with no ObjC surface: nothing can be read out of them and nothing can be put between them. What can be
// set is the table's header or footer view, which is how Speed and pitch has ridden on the player's menu
// since it shipped (Shared/Player/SpeedPitchMenu.x). So the block goes in the header, above Spotify's own
// rows, and is laid out by hand at the table's width.
//
// **And why not a menu of the redesign's own instead.** Building the sheet would mean owning its contents:
// every row Spotify offers for a playlist, which varies by whose playlist it is, by market, by account and
// by flag, each in the app's language and each doing something only Spotify's own code knows how to do.
// None of that can be read off the item factories, so it would have to be a hard-coded list in one
// language that goes stale the day Spotify adds a row -- the same trap the album's footer and the artist's
// sections are written to avoid. Spotify keeps its rows; the mod adds to them.
//
// Which sheet is the playlist's: the ⋯ that opened it is the redesign's own pinned button
// (Kit/SGRActionRow.h), so it records its page as it is tapped and a sheet that appears within
// SGRPinnedMoreWindow of that belongs to it. Under the native look nothing pins a ⋯ and nothing here runs.
//
// What each row does is fire Spotify's own pill, so the action, the sheet Sort opens and the state Mix
// keeps are all Spotify's; the words are read off the pills for the same reason. The pills sit in a list
// cell closed up to nothing, which the page hands over as it lays out (SGRPlaylistTakeCuration) and which
// is held from the page, so they are still there to fire once the list has scrolled past them.
