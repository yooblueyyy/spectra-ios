// Tree (trees/clean/library/03.txt:30-73, 06.txt:28-40): every cell of the list is a
// YourLibrarySwipeableCollectionViewCellContainer holding either a 402x80 row -- id=Playlist.Row.Library,
// Album.Row.Library or Podcast.Row.Library, all three an AutoLayoutStackView {16, 8} 370x64 of
// id=Artwork.Row.Library 64x64 r=4 and, 12pt after it, the title over its kind and its owner -- or a
// 112.67x161.33 card, id=Components.UI.CardLibrary, over id=Components.UI.CardLibrary.Artwork r=4.
//
// Two things are changed, both of them the Music app's library. The artwork takes the Kit's radius for its
// size with continuous corners, Spotify's 4pt being the square corner of its own look; an artist's picture
// already carries a radius half its side and is left the circle it is (r=32 in the trees, 2 of the 90 rows
// recorded). And a hairline runs between the rows from the text's leading edge, which is where a library list
// draws one -- a layer rather than a view, since the rows are reused as fast as the list scrolls, with its
// actions off so a reused row does not slide its line into place.
