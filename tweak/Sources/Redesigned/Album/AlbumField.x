// Album redesign: the artwork field behind the whole page, and what the switch forces.
//
// Tree (trees/clean/album/01.txt:22). The page is CreativeWorkPlatform.CreativeWorkTemplateView, and it
// holds, in this order: the header's colour wash (a LegacyUI HeaderView the height of the header, with
// Spotify's GradientView in it), CreativeWorkPlatform.Tab with the scrolling list inside it, the sticky
// HeaderNavigationBar, and the two controls Spotify floats over the page, shuffle and play. Nothing of it
// scrolls except what is inside the Tab, so a field put behind the lot stays still while the cover at the
// top of the header slides up over it -- which is what the Music app does with the page colour.
//
// So the field is the page's bottom-most view, the size of the view and bleeding past it, with no backdrop
// of its own: the sharp cover at the top of the header is the picture, and AlbumHeader.x fades it into
// exactly this field's colour, and conceals Spotify's wash so the field is what shows. What Spotify paints
// over the field -- the list and every row, all of them the base surface -- is kept clear by the Kit's
// repaint hook while sgr_albumRoot is this page, and by the list's own pass below, which paints itself
// rather than through a layer the repaint hook would hear about.
//
// The colour is Spotify's own for the album, read off the wash it paints behind the header, which
// AlbumHeader.x hands over as it conceals it. Spotify reads the whole cover; the Kit's palette reads its
// bottom edge, and a scanned cover's bottom edge is the scanner's pale border, which turned the field grey
// where Spotify had it blue (device, 2026-09-18). The colour read from the cover is what shows until
// Spotify's arrives, or for good if it never does, and before either the field is the neutral one.
//
// The page is the album's by its identifier, which is how Native/Album/Album.x has told it apart since it
// shipped: the artist page is TemplateKit's TemplateView instead. A podcast's episode page is built from
// this same template (trees/continuous/1.txt 2026-09-20: CreativeWorkTemplateView over Element_List cells
// of EpisodePage_ModernEpisodePageImpl), so it is given the field too, and everything below that holds for
// the album holds for it. What it puts on the field is its own -- a description, a comments card, Episode
// Transcript, See all episodes -- and only the paint is taken off it; AlbumHeader.x and AlbumSections.x
// look for the album's own elements and find none of them there.
