// The album redesign: Spotify's album page kept, with its header, its track list and its controls, and laid
// out the way the Music app lays an album out -- the same page the playlist redesign gives a playlist, so
// the two read as one app.
//
// The album page is not the playlist's. It is built by the Creative Work Platform out of the element
// framework (trees/clean/album/01.txt: CreativeWorkPlatform.CreativeWorkTemplateView, a header element over
// one list), its header is a column of stack views rather than a plain block, and its play and shuffle
// float over the page instead of scrolling with the header. So none of Redesigned/Playlist/ is shared: only
// the Kit is, which is what keeps the look the same.
//
//     AlbumField.x     the artwork field behind the whole page, the artwork it is read from, the flags the
//                      screen forces
//     AlbumHeader.x    the header: the cover full bleed at the top dissolving into the field, and the Kit's
//                      SGRHeaderInfo over it -- title, artist, kind and date, shuffle, a white Play, add
//     AlbumRows.x      the track rows on the field with no surface of their own and a hairline between them
//     AlbumSections.x  everything under the tracks dropped but the album's own line and its copyright: no
//                      more by the artist, no videos, no concerts, no merch, no you might also like
//
// Every hook installs only while Redesigned UI is on (SGRedesignedUI); the native look's do not then.
// Threading: main thread only.
