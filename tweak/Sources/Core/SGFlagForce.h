// The flags something of the mod's forces, gathered in one place so that the flag provider
// (Shared/Flags/Flags.x) and the flag rows of the settings pages (Settings/SGModPage.m) ask here
// rather than knowing every feature that forces one: the ad blocking, the lyrics sources, the redesign.
//
// A forcer answers a flag key with the value it forces, or nil. `atLaunch` answers for the running
// app, from the switches as they were at launch; `locked`, which may be nil, answers for a settings
// row, from the switches as they are stored now, and a row it answers for shows that value and takes
// no touch. A forcer that `beatsOverride` is asked before an override from the All flags page, the
// rest after it; within each group in the order they were registered.
// Threading: register from a %ctor or a constructor, before Spotify reads a flag; ask from any thread.
