// Spotify's /color-lyrics/v2/track/<id> answered with the chain's lyrics, in the URLSession delegates
// Spotify reads the reply through, SPTDataLoaderService and HttpClientURLSession, the way
// EeveeSpotify Reincarnated answers it on 9.1 (DataLoaderServiceHooks.x.swift). Three cases:
//
// Spotify has lyrics of its own (a 200). The body is read in whole and handed on with the chain's
// lines in place of Spotify's when they are timed, on the main queue, which 9.1.60 and later require
// of these callbacks. This is the path that is known to put the lyrics card under the player.
//
// Spotify's own metadata says the track has none. Its request is sent to a donor track instead, one
// that has lyrics everywhere, and the 200 that comes back has its lines swapped for the chain's as
// above: a 404 turned into a 200 in the delegate alone never showed a card on 9.1.78, however fast
// it came, while a real 200 with our lines in it always did. The donor's own lines are never shown:
// with nothing from the chain the request is failed as Spotify's would have been. The player-track
// hook below notes what the metadata said, and forces has_lyrics on so the request is made at all.
//
// A 404 for a track the metadata has not been seen for. The reply is held where it arrives, its
// completion handler with it, until the chain has answered; the delegate is then told of a 200, the
// lyrics and the end, and the task's own response answers the same 200, since Spotify's client may
// read the status from either. Spotify's real 404 body that follows is dropped, so the task is
// answered exactly once.
//
// Whichever lines win go to the karaoke page as well, and the source that supplied them is credited
// there.
//
// None of that shows a card on its own. The cards under the player are a list the server sends per
// track, scrollsita's NpvScrollResponse, and it holds a lyrics section only for tracks Spotify has
// lyrics for; the lyrics provider is asked for a track only when its section is in the list. So the
// list is read on the way in and a lyrics section is put at its top for any track without one that
// a source may have lyrics for. The section's shape is copied from the last list that carried one,
// with the track's own URI inside; before any has passed, it is the URI alone. The player then asks
// for the lyrics as it would for any track, and the reply is answered as above.
