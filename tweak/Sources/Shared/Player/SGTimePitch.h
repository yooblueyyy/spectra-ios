// The player menu's Speed and Pitch applied to sound: Apple's own time and pitch unit (AUNewTimePitch,
// the one behind AVAudioUnitTimePitch), which plays its input faster or slower at the same pitch (rate),
// and higher or lower at the same speed (semitones).
//
// It takes its input one of two ways:
//
// - Pulled from a source: the unit asks the source for about rate times the frames it hands back, so a
//   rate over 1 consumes the music faster. This is how speed works, the source being Spotify's mixer.
// - In place: the buffer is pushed into a FIFO and the unit pulled for as many frames as came in, rate 1
//   only. This is pitch alone on a finished buffer, when there is no source to pull.
//
// Measured on the Mac (harness/pitch): the pitch exact to 0.01% at any rate, the rate exact in frames
// consumed, about 0.2% of a core, and the sound 4096 frames (93 ms at 44.1 kHz) later than it went in.
//
// Plain C over audio units: SGTimePitchRender and SGTimePitchProcess run on Core Audio's render
// thread, so they never allocate, lock, log or send a message. The rest is for any other thread.
// Compiles on the Mac as is.
