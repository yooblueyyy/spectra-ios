A no-jailbreak Theos tweak that rebuilds Spotify for iOS in Liquid Glass, injected into your own
decrypted IPA and signed with your own certificate.

Built and tested on **Spotify 9.1.78** — use that version's IPA. The mod hooks Spotify's own classes,
which change between releases, so another version may build and then break.

| | |
|---|---|
| The redesign | **iOS 26+** |
| Legacy look | iOS 16.1+ |
| Live Activity | iOS 17+ |

The redesign is `UIGlassEffect`, which only exists from iOS 26. Below that the Redesigned UI switch
is greyed out and the mod runs Spotify's own screens with everything else it adds on top. Both live
in Settings → Mod Settings.

## Build it

No IPA is distributed. Bring a decrypted **Spotify 9.1.78** IPA; you get an unsigned
`spoti.pw-<mod version>.ipa` to sign with SideStore, Feather or any certificate signer. Each
[release](https://github.com/skopevoj/spoti.pw/releases) also carries the tweak's `.deb`.

### Build with GitHub Actions

Fork the repo, enable Actions, run **Build IPA from your own Spotify IPA**. It takes a direct link to
your decrypted `.ipa` and hands the built IPA back as a workflow artifact. No Mac needed; the link is
masked in the log and the result stays in your fork.

### Build on a Mac

Theos in `~/theos` and Xcode with an iPhoneOS 26+ SDK (`xcode-select` it). An SDK in `~/theos/sdks`
alone builds too, but without the Live Activity. Then:

    brew install make ldid dpkg zsign ideviceinstaller libimobiledevice
    uv tool install "cyan @ git+https://github.com/asdfzxcvbn/pyzule-rw"

Put the decrypted `.ipa` in `ipa/`, then:

    make release    # out/spoti.pw-<version>.ipa, ready to sign
    make install    # the same, signed with your certificate and pushed over USB

`make install` reads `SIGN_P12`, `SIGN_PROFILE` and `SIGN_P12_PASSWORD` from `.signing.env`; copy
`.signing.env.example` and fill it in.

The first build spends a minute reading Spotify's flags out of your IPA. `make flags` regenerates it.

### Signing

Sign with a bundle id matching your certificate's App ID. If it doesn't match, the app still works
but tapping the player on the lock screen won't open it — and it tells you on first launch which id
to use. In Feather, copy the App ID into **Identifier** and leave **PPQ protection** off; AltStore,
SideStore and Sideloadly get this right on their own.

The app keeps Spotify's bundle id, so it installs over the real Spotify.

## Support

Free, and staying that way — no paid tier, no supporter-only builds. If it made your phone nicer
to use, a coffee is a good way to say so.
